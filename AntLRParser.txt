If you want to avoid downloading this additional JAR, you need to
install an additional feature into your Eclipse. Use this update site:
http://download.itemis.com/updates/releases/
Navigate to the Xtext Antlr category and install the feature Xtext
Antlr SDK Feature. When you restarted Eclipse, if you create
a new Xtext project from scratch and you run Generate Xtext
Artifacts, then the additional JAR is not needed anymore.
